                <p>My journey has been defined by a love for learning and personal growth.
                Growing up in Algeria, I developed a passion for technology, which inspired me to study Computer Information System
                at El Camino College. Along the way, I have faced challenges that have shaped my character and fueled my desire to explore 
        new opportunities. I am excited about what the future holds as I continue to learn and grow.</p>

            <p>Each step along the journey transforms dreams into reality. Fueled by determination and resilience, every challenge faced becomes a building block toward success and fulfillmen</p>
            <p>"Success is not the destination, but the journey that leads us there"</p>
